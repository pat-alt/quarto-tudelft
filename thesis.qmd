# Introduction

This is a Quarto extension for generating your TU Delft PhD Thesis in Quarto.

# Cool Quarto Things

## Custom Callouts 

The template adds custom cross-references that can be combined with standard callout blocks like @nte-custom. 

<!-- TODO: Adapt when possible -->

::: {#nte-custom .callout-note}

## Current Limitations

This is a makeshift solution that relies on setting the default behaviour of callout blocks to `callout-appearance: simple`. We rely on the default style of callout blocks, e.g. the `.callout-tip` for questions, where the light bulb icon sort of makes sense.

Ideally, we would like to have either custom callout blocks or custom theorem environments. There is [coatless-quarto/custom-callouts](https://quarto.thecoatlessprofessor.com/custom-callout/qcustom-callout-faq.html), which unfortunately does not support PDF, and [ute/custom-numbered-blocks](https://github.com/ute/custom-numbered-blocks), which I could not get to work in combination with custom cross-references. For custom cross-references, Quarto currently only supports float environments, so no custom theorem environments are supported yet.

@trq-what is a Thesis Research Question.

::: {.callout-tip #trq-what}

## What are Thesis Research Questions?

This is a Thesis Research Question, that you might want to use in the introduction of your thesis. It can be cross-referenced using the custom `trq` key. 

:::

@rq-what is a standard Research Question.

::: {.callout-tip #rq-what}

## What are Research Questions?

This is a standard Research Question, that you might want to use in any individual chapter. It can be cross-referenced using the custom `rq` key.
