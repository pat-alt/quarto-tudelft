# TU Delft Format for Quarto

## About

This extension adds a couple of Quarto extensions that should be useful for anyone at TU Delft interested in using Quarto. 

> [!WARNING]
> This is a work in progress and not all things are polished at this point.


## Installing

```zsh
quarto use template quarto-tudelft/quarto-tudelft
```

This will install the extension and create an example `.qmd` file that you can use as a starting place for your presentation.

Alternatively, if you've done this before, you can also add this template to an existing project like so:

```zsh
quarto add quarto-tudelft/quarto-tudelft
```

## Updating

I will likely continue to improve this template. Updates can be fetched as follows:

```zsh
quarto update quarto-tudelft/quarto-tudelft
```

## Usage

Usage is outlined in the template document: [template.qmd](template.qmd). You can find the rendered version here.
